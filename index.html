    <h1 class="title">Rothko Painting</h1>
    <p class="description"><a class="link" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko">Mark Rothko</a> was an influential American abstract painter known for his large, color-field paintings. His works often consisted of rectangular forms or blocks of color on vast canvases. Rothko's paintings aimed to evoke emotional and spiritual responses through the careful arrangement of colors, creating a contemplative and immersive experience for viewers. He believed that his art had the power to convey profound emotions and inner thoughts without representing recognizable figures or objects. Rothko's style is characterized by its simplicity, use of vivid colors, and the intention to engage viewers on an emotional level.</p>
